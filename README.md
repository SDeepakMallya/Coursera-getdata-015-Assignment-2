This repository contains my second assignment for the Coursera couse "Getting and Cleaning Data".

This repo contains 3 files.
  - [run_analysis.R](https://github.com/SDeepakMallya/Coursera-getdata-015-Assignment-2/blob/master/run_analysis.R) : This R script contains the code which when executed gives out the desired output
  - [CodeBook.md]() : This markdown file contains the description of variables present in the data set
  - [Summarised Dataset.txt](https://github.com/SDeepakMallya/Coursera-getdata-015-Assignment-2/blob/master/Summarised Dataset.txt) : This text file contains the tidy data

The data being summarised is taken from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)
